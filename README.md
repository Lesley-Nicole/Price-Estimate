# Price Estimate

 A simple price estimate template for contractors and business owners.

## Overview

 I am a beginner, so this template may not be perfect. It serves its purpose though, which is to send a price estimate that to a potential client. *Feel free to correct any mistakes I may have made. I am always open to any tips that will help me learn. Thank you!*

**Estimate VS Quote**
 A price estimate is different from a price quote. A price quote is given to a potential client when the exact amount of a job is known. The amount stated doesn't change. A price estimate is given when the exact amount for the job could possible change. The stated amount in an estimate should be what the job is expected to cost. It's also good practice to include the "worst case scenario" amount, which is the most the job could possiby cost. Some examples could include flooring installers, plumbers, electricians, and many others.

### **Details**

I made this template with **HTML/CSS** on one page, and the background image is a **png file** added to the project root. It has text areas to list materials, labor costs, and the expected price. I also included a disclaimer at the bottom to help explain pricing. I recommend sending estimates in a pdf. There are several ways to make a pdf, but for this project, I opened the html file in a **pdf creator** that I downloaded from the Microsoft store.
